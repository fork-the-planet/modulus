### Hello World

You can start using PhysicsNeMo in your PyTorch code as simply as shown here:

```python
>>> import torch
>>> from physicsnemo.models.mlp.fully_connected import FullyConnected
>>> model = FullyConnected(in_features=32, out_features=64)
>>> input = torch.randn(128, 32)
>>> output = model(input)
>>> output.shape
torch.Size([128, 64])
```

To use the distributed module, you can do the following (example for
distributed data parallel training; for a more in-depth tutorial, refer to
[PhysicsNeMo Distributed](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/physicsnemo/physicsnemo-core/api/physicsnemo.distributed.html#)):

```python
import torch
from torch.nn.parallel import DistributedDataParallel
from physicsnemo.distributed import DistributedManager
from physicsnemo.models.mlp.fully_connected import FullyConnected

def main():
    DistributedManager.initialize()
    dist = DistributedManager()

    arch = FullyConnected(in_features=32, out_features=64).to(dist.device)

    if dist.distributed:
        ddps = torch.cuda.Stream()
        with torch.cuda.stream(ddps):
            arch = DistributedDataParallel(
                arch,
                device_ids=[dist.local_rank],
                output_device=dist.device,
                broadcast_buffers=dist.broadcast_buffers,
                find_unused_parameters=dist.find_unused_parameters,
            )
        torch.cuda.current_stream().wait_stream(ddps)

    # Set up the optimizer
    optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(
        arch.parameters(),
        lr=0.001,
    )

    def training_step(invar, target):
        pred = arch(invar)
        loss = torch.sum(torch.pow(pred - target, 2))
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        return loss

    # Sample training loop
    for i in range(20):
        # Random inputs and targets for simplicity
        input = torch.randn(128, 32, device=dist.device)
        target = torch.randn(128, 64, device=dist.device)

        # Training step
        loss = training_step(input, target)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

To use the PDE module, you can do the following:

```python
>>> from physicsnemo.sym.eq.pdes.navier_stokes import NavierStokes
>>> ns = NavierStokes(nu=0.01, rho=1, dim=2)
>>> ns.pprint()
continuity: u__x + v__y
momentum_x: u*u__x + v*u__y + p__x + u__t - 0.01*u__x__x - 0.01*u__y__y
momentum_y: u*v__x + v*v__y + p__y + v__t - 0.01*v__x__x - 0.01*v__y__y
```

## Installation

The following instructions help you install the base PhysicsNeMo modules to get
started. In addition to this, optional dependencies can be installed to provide
additional functionality. A complete list of optional dependencies is available
in the [`pyproject.toml`](./pyproject.toml) file.

The [training recipes](./examples) are not packaged into the pip wheels or the
container to keep the footprint low. We recommend users clone the appropriate
training recipes and use them as a starting point. These training recipes may
require additional example-specific dependencies, as indicated through an
associated `requirements.txt` file in such cases.

### CUDA Backend Selection

> **Important:** To get GPU-accelerated RAPIDS packages (cuML, pylibraft, cupy)
> and a CUDA-matched PyTorch build, you **must** include either `cu13` or `cu12`
> when installing. Feature extras like `nn-extras` and `utils-extras` provide
> additional non-CUDA packages (scipy, natten, wandb, etc.) but do not include
> RAPIDS dependencies on their own.

PhysicsNeMo supports both CUDA 12 and CUDA 13 backends. The backend is selected
via an extra that is orthogonal to the feature extras - combine them freely:

| Extra | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `cu13` | PyTorch (CUDA 13.0), cuML-cu13, pylibraft-cu13, cupy-cuda13x |
| `cu12` | PyTorch (CUDA 12.8), cuML-cu12, pylibraft-cu12, cupy-cuda12x |
| *(neither)* | PyTorch from PyPI (default build), **no RAPIDS packages** |

### PyPI

The recommended method for installing the latest version of PhysicsNeMo is using PyPI:

```Bash
pip install nvidia-physicsnemo
python -c "import physicsnemo; print('PhysicsNeMo version:', physicsnemo.__version__)"
```

To install with a specific CUDA backend and optional feature extras:

```Bash
# CUDA 13 backend with nn-extras
pip install "nvidia-physicsnemo[cu13,nn-extras]"

# CUDA 12 backend with nn-extras
pip install "nvidia-physicsnemo[cu12,nn-extras]"
```

Other feature extras (`utils-extras`, `mesh-extras`, `model-extras`,
`datapipes-extras`, `gnns`) can be combined in the same way.

The installation can also be verified by running the [Hello World](#hello-world) example.

### uv

For development or to run examples, we recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
to clone the repository and sync dependencies:

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo.git
cd physicsnemo
uv sync --extra cu13
uv run python -c "import physicsnemo; print('PhysicsNeMo version:', physicsnemo.__version__)"
```

To install with optional feature extras (e.g., `nn-extras`):

```Bash
uv sync --extra cu13 --extra nn-extras
```

For a CUDA 12 environment, replace `cu13` with `cu12`:

```Bash
uv sync --extra cu12 --extra nn-extras
```

### NVCR Container

The recommended PhysicsNeMo Docker image can be pulled from the
[NVIDIA Container Registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/physicsnemo/containers/physicsnemo)
(refer to the NGC registry for the latest tag):

```Bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06
```

Inside the container, you can clone the PhysicsNeMo git repositories and get
started with the examples. The command below shows the instructions to launch
the PhysicsNeMo container and run examples from this repo:

```bash
docker run --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --runtime nvidia \
--rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:25.06 bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo.git
cd physicsnemo/examples/cfd/darcy_fno/
pip install warp-lang # install NVIDIA Warp to run the Darcy example
python train_fno_darcy.py
```

### From Source

For a local build of the PhysicsNeMo Python package from source, use:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/physicsnemo.git && cd physicsnemo

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
python -c "import physicsnemo; print('PhysicsNeMo version:', physicsnemo.__version__)"
```

### Building Docker from Source

To build the PhysicsNeMo Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t physicsnemo:deploy \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target deploy -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-deploy`.

To build the CI image:

```bash
docker build -t physicsnemo:ci \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target ci -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-ci`.

### Platform Support

For pip or uv installation, Linux, macOS (ARM), and Windows are supported.

Docker containers are available for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms only.
If using `linux/arm64`, some dependencies like `warp-lang` might not install correctly.

## PhysicsNeMo Migration Guide

NVIDIA Modulus has been renamed to NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo. For migration:

- Use `pip install nvidia-physicsnemo` rather than `pip install nvidia-modulus`
  for PyPI wheels.
- Use `nvcr.io/nvidia/physicsnemo/physicsnemo:<tag>` rather than
  `nvcr.io/nvidia/modulus/modulus:<tag>` for Docker containers.
- Replace `nvidia-modulus` with `nvidia-physicsnemo` in your pip requirements
  files (`requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.).
- In your code, change the import statements from `import modulus` to
  `import physicsnemo`.

The old PyPI registry and the NGC container registry will be deprecated soon
and will not receive any bug fixes/updates. The old checkpoints will remain
compatible with these updates.

More details to follow soon.

## DGL to PyTorch Geometric Migration Guide

PhysicsNeMo supports a wide range of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs),
including MeshGraphNet and others.
Currently, PhysicsNeMo uses the DGL library as its GNN backend,
with plans to completely transition to PyTorch Geometric (PyG) in a future release.
For more details, please refer to the [DGL-to-PyG migration guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/physicsnemo/blob/main/examples/dgl_to_pyg_migration.md).
